      This is a container with fixed position inside another container. It has the same effect as the first fixed container, which is not inside a container, because with fixed positioning, being the child of a parent or not makes no difference. All fixed elements are "permanently" affixed to the viewport and stay put despite scrolling as they are coded to be positioned.
